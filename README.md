## Short Description
An assignment for a software engineering course at Boston University to create a game similar to dominos that our instructor calls "blokus."

## Purpose of the Project
This project was developed for a class. It is intended for practice only.

## Long Description
This project was created for EC 327 - Introduction to Software Engineering at Boston University.

Our assignment for "HW4" is to create a game that our instructor calls "blokus." The game is similar to dominos, but it uses a variety of shapes created with "polyominos." In short, the game is played on a board like dominos and uses shapes similar to the game Tetris, which are created from 1x1 pieces called polyominos.

The goal of our assignment is to create the game with succinct and efficient C++ programming; we are given a target length for our program.

## What is done with this project ...
This repository was created for the assignment and not maintained after creation.

## What you can do with it...
Please enjoy the contents of this project as a brief demonstration of some C++ and software design concepts, but it was merely developed for a learning experience.
